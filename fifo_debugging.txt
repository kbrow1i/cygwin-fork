Tests:

 - fifo_seqnum in tlpi-dist/pipes.  Test with and without O_RDWR.

 - fifo_exec_test, fifo_fork_test, fifo_select_test in
   programming/misc_examples.  In each case, run the program and do
   "echo blah > /tmp/myfifo" in a separate terminal.  For
   fifo_exec_test, can also run with an arbitrary argument; it should
   fail.  Some or all of these can be tested with and without O_RDWR.
   Can also run them under strace and look for exceptions.  I've found
   many "Invalid Handle" exceptions that way.

 - fifo_fcntl_test in programming/misc_examples.  Run the program and
   do "exec 7</tmp/myfifo" in another terminal.

 - make check in src/texinfo/info.  If it fails, can run individual
   tests, e.g., t/malformed-split.sh.  Can run "sh
   t/malformed-split.sh" under gdb or strace.

 - In home directory, fifo1.sh in one terminal, fifo2.sh in a second.

 - Duplex test.

   $ cat ~/src/cygwin-fork/winsup/cygwin/fifo_duplex_test.sh
   #!/bin/sh
   set -x
   rm -f foo
   mkfifo foo
   exec 7<>foo
   echo blah >&7
   read bar <&7
   echo $bar

For testing builds, I have scripts mybuild.sh and mybuild1.sh in
/c/cygwin64/bin (to be run as administrator in a 32-bit shell) that
copy the build results (cygwin1.dll and cygwin1.dbg).  The first
copies them from src/cygwin-fork.  The second copies them from
src/cygdll/newlib-cygwin.
